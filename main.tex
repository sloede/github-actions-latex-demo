\section{Motivation}
This repository serves as a demonstrator for how to set up GitHub Actions to automatically build a
LaTex PDF on pushing to the repository's main branch. The built PDF will be pushed to a separate
branch to allow a persistent (= convenient) link from the repository README file.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Usage}
Have a look at the GitHub Actions workflow file in \texttt{.github/workflows/ci.yml}. The link to
the produced LaTex file can be found in the \texttt{README.md}.
